        <h2>Devil Fruits</h2>
        <p>Devil Fruits are mysterious, distinctive fruits scattered throughout the world, known for permanently granting their eaters superhuman powers and an equally permanent inability to swim. With only one notable exception, an individual can only acquire the powers of a single Devil Fruit and survive, and once they die, the fruit is reborn for another to eat.<br>
        <p>Every Devil Fruit grants a special power to anyone who eats it. Some fruits grant powers that are similar to others, but each and every one is unique to itself; that said, there is no Devil Fruit that has the same exact power as another. These fruits are broadly grouped into three types: Paramecia, which grant a wide variety of strange superhuman abilities, from the simplest abilities to highly destructive ones; Zoan, which allows a user to transform into a specific animal as well as an animal hybrid, including prehistoric and even mythological ones; and Logia, which grants a user the power to create, control, and transform their body into a natural element, and is widely considered the rarest and most powerful class of Devil Fruit.<br></p>

        <p>Devil Fruits have empowered many of the world's most significant individuals, especially among the Three Great Powers. This, along with their general rarity, causes them to be highly sought-after; single specimens may be valued at hundreds of millions in Belly, and extensive efforts have been made to mass-produce artificial versions for warfare.</p>
